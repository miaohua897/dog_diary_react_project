       diary:'Today, I saw it. The enemy. A squirrel! It darted across the yard, and I was ready—tail wagging, paws poised. I sprinted at full speed, my ears flapping, but alas, the squirrel was too fast. It climbed the tree and mocked me with its fluffy tail. I barked and barked. I will catch you one day, little squirrel. Mark my words.',

I dreamt I was running through fields of treats, and every time I caught one, it turned into a ball. It was the perfect nap. If only I could convince my humans to nap more too.',

They are taking their sweet time with dinner, and my nose knows—something delicious is in the air. But no, they won’t let me help. I’ll just sit here and stare some more. Maybe if I stare hard enough, they’ll feel bad and drop some crumbs.',
